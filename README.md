# (NOT COMPLETELY FINISHED)
**PickMeUp** is a fully functional auto-rickshaw booking platform built using Django, Channels (for WebSocket real-time features), Leaflet.js (for maps), and a clean mobile-first UI.

This project was developed entirely within a browser-based environment (Glitch + GitHub Codespaces), without using a physical PC or external IDE. It is optimized for mobile screens and designed to provide a seamless experience for both users and drivers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Ride Tracking**  
  Drivers' live location is sent via WebSocket and displayed to the user on a Leaflet map.

- **User & Driver Authentication**  
  Clean registration and login flow for both users and drivers, with role-based dashboard redirection.

- **Auto Discovery & Booking**  
  Users can see available drivers, check fares, and request rides based on live coordinates.

- **Live Driver Info**  
  Driver name, bio, vehicle info, and profile image are shown during active rides.

- **Secure Ride Cancellation**  
  Built-in OTP and cancellation logic with CSRF protection for POST operations.

- **Driver Side Interface**  
  Drivers can accept rides, send location updates, and view passenger details.

- **Modern UI**  
  Professional, responsive, and clean interface inspired by platforms like Tukxi — designed for usability and clarity.
